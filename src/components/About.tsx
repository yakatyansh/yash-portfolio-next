        I'm a software engineer with a knack for problem-solving and building
        scalable, maintainable web applications. I love working with cutting-edge
        technologies like Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and more. When Iâ€™m not
        coding, you can find me playing badminton or jamming to my favorite beats.
